# Powershell

Inside of the `scripts` folder, folder names relate to the authors / names of the makers of the scripts.

I am ***NOT*** taking credit for these, I am only making them accessable via `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-Expression`.

## Scripts

Powershell scripts to use with "iwr" and "iex" commands with.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://powershell.cadenf.com/SCRIPT_NAME.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
```
